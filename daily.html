            <span class="drop-cap">T</span>he Undermine Undertakers confirmed this week that they
            have formally committed to the Pipeworks Project, an ongoing effort to document
            practical failures, near-misses, misunderstandings, and "things that seemed like a good
            idea at the time."
          </p>

          <p>
            The project, which will be maintained in ledger form and updated as circumstances allow,
            is not intended to prevent mistakes entirely. Instead, it aims to make them legible. "A
            failure that can be read is a failure that can be survived," said one Undertaker,
            speaking from behind a stack of damp papers that were, at one point, thought to be a
            map.
          </p>

            Pipeworks began as a modest attempt to keep track of tools. It has since expanded to
            include misplaced assumptions, misaligned expectations, and several entries labelled
            only 'Do Not Repeat', underlined twice. Unlike previous initiatives, the Pipeworks
            Project does not seek to identify fault. No individual names will be recorded unless
            they insist. Responsibility, the Undertakers note, is often distributed unevenly and
            arrives late.
          </p>

          <p>
            Early trials of the system have already yielded results. A recurring issue involving a
            vibrating brass key was eventually traced not to enchantment, but to a table being
            slightly uneven. The key has been returned to service. The table has not.
          </p>

          <p>
            Importantly, the ledger includes space for what was learned, what was ignored, and what
            was quietly worked around. Several pages remain blank. These are not considered
            failures.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            "We expect to get this wrong," the statement continues. "What matters is that we
            remember how."
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The Undertakers emphasised that Pipeworks is not a corrective programme, nor a
            disciplinary one. It is, instead, a record of honest work carried out under imperfect
            conditions, by people doing their best with partial information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Market observers have already noted a subtle shift in tone among participating crews.
            Errors are being reported earlier. Explanations are becoming shorter. Bells are being
            rung less often. The project is expected to continue indefinitely, or until it proves
            unnecessary. No timeline has been provided.
