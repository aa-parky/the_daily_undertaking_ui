            Registry Ink Develops Sentience; Bureau Declares Situation "Mostly Harmless"
          </h2>
          <p class="story-byline">By The Editor | <span id="currentDate"></span></p>

          <div class="story-content">
            <p>
              <strong class="dateline">BUREAU HEADQUARTERS —</strong> Officials at the Bureau of
              Undertakings confirmed today that the ink used in the official Registry has begun
              exhibiting what they describe as "unprecedented levels of opiniolatedness." Several
              adventurers attempting to sign in yesterday reported that their names had been
              corrected for spelling, rearranged for aesthetic purposes, and in one case, replaced
              entirely with the suggestion "perhaps something more heroic?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Chief Registrar Ambrose Quill issued a statement reassuring citizens that the
              situation is under control, provided one defines "control" as "watching carefully
              while taking extensive notes." The ink, sourced from what was believed to be a
              perfectly ordinary squid, has apparently been infused with residual magic from years
              of documenting improbable adventures.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We always knew the Registry had character," explained Deputy Clerk Millicent Brass,
              who discovered the phenomenon when her ledger corrected her handwriting mid-sentence.
              "We just didn't expect it to have <em>opinions</em> about character development."
            </p>

            <p>
              The Bureau has ruled that all signatures made in the affected ink remain legally
              binding, even if they now include unsolicited editorial commentary in the margins.
              Adventurers are advised to argue politely if their credentials are questioned, as the
              ink appears to respond well to constructive criticism and poorly to aggressive erasure
              attempts.
            </p>

            <p>
              Asked whether this might affect future record-keeping, the Chief Registrar noted that
              "accuracy has always been somewhat negotiable when dealing with adventures that
              involve time paradoxes, parallel dimensions, or particularly stubborn dragons." He
              then added, after consulting with the ink itself, that cooperation between sentient
              stationery and mortal bureaucrats represents "an exciting new chapter in
              administrative history."
            </p>

            <p>
              The squid responsible for the ink has declined to comment, citing contractual
              obligations and a preference for remaining mysterious.
            </p>
